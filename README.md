DisplayDrive is a Python program designed to adjust and optimize display drivers and settings on Windows computers. It caters to different media types such as gaming, movies, and work by changing the screen resolution and refresh rate.

## Features

- **Adjust Screen Resolution:** Automatically sets the optimal resolution for different media types.
- **Set Refresh Rate:** Adjusts refresh rates to provide the best experience for gaming, movies, and work.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

This code and README provide a basic framework for the `DisplayDrive` program. Note that the code includes placeholders for setting refresh rates as this usually requires specific hardware APIs or third-party tools that are not available in the Python standard library.
